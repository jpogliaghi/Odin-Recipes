        <li>Cut the aubergines into quarters lengthways, then cut the quarters into 2.5cm/1in slices. Cut the courgettes
            into 2.5cm/1in slices. De-seed the peppers and cut them into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>To peel the tomatoes, score a cross in the base of each tomato and place them in a heatproof bowl. Pour over
